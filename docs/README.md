# Password Manager - DevOps Project

## Version 1.0

### Overview
This is the first completed version of the Password Manager application. It includes basic functionality for managing passwords via a web interface with a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

### Features
1. Add Password: Add a new username and encrypted password.
2. Retrieve Password: Retrieve a stored password by username.
3. List Passwords: View a list of stored usernames.
4. Validation:
   - Ensures passwords are encrypted before storing.
   - Checks for duplicate usernames.
   - Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

### Installation and Setup

#### Backend
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/password-manager.git
   cd password-manager
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   pm2 start src/server.js --name password-manager
   ```

#### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd password-manager-frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### 1. Project Phases and Progress

#### Phase 1: Planning and Research
   - Defined the projectâ€™s core functionality:
     - Password storage with encryption, retrieval, and listing capabilities.
   - Security Requirements:
     - Passwords are encrypted using AES-256 before being stored.
     - Integrated with Firestore on GCP for persistent storage, using secure service accounts.
   - Tool Selection:
     - **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API routing.
     - **Database**: Firestore on GCP for secure data storage.
     - **Encryption**: Node.js `crypto` library for strong password encryption.

#### Phase 2: Development Setup and Version Control
   - Project Folder Structure:
     - `/src`: Main application code (API routes, encryption functions).
     - `/tests`: Placeholder for future test files.
     - `/docs`: Documentation for the project.
   - Initial Server Setup:
     - Created a Node.js Express server with API routes for password management.
   - Version Control and Branching:
     - Set up GitHub repository with `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files.
     - Branching strategy: `main`, `dev`, and feature branches for clear project tracking.

## Backend Progress

### Summary
The backend for the password manager has been successfully implemented and tested locally. It includes the following features:
- Password encryption using AES-256-CBC.
- Local storage of encrypted passwords in a JSON file.
- API routes for adding, retrieving, and listing passwords.

### Local Testing
The backend is running locally on `http://localhost:3000`. Endpoints have been tested with `curl`, and all functionalities are working as expected.

### Next Steps
- Integrate the backend with the frontend using Axios.
- Migrate the backend to use Firestore on Google Cloud once the local implementation is stable.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: JavaScript (Node.js)
- **Framework**: Express for backend API routing
- **Database**: Firestore (GCP) with Firebase Admin SDK for database integration
- **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC encryption using Node.js `crypto` module
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for version tracking and collaboration
- **Development Tools**: Postman for API testing, VS Code as the primary IDE
